 I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . 
 But I often skip his classes , and he doesn't like me . 
 I've tried it , but he would have none of it . 
 I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . 
 I ’ Ve tried a hundred times , but I just can ’ t seem to kick the habit . 
 How he manages to do that is always a mystery to me . 
 I've heard about that , but I've never tried it . 
 I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm . 
 He sometimes really drives me crazy . 
 He usually keeps me posted . 
 So does my father . I'm already used to it . 
 Actually , he's the most dependable person I know , and he would never turn on anyone . 
 It's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it .

I bought it . I got a watch , too . The company that sells this car has a car club . 
 It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . 
 I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . 
 Yes , it's used , but she said it was in very good shape . It's a small foreign car . 
 Yes , it's used , but she said it was in very good shape.It ' s a small foreign car . 
 I was going to cash it at the hotel , but one of my friends said that banks always give better exchange rates . 
 I know that magazine . It ’ s very popular . 
 I got it on sale down at the department store . 
 Yeah , I think so . I think the hotel is right across the street from a post office . It is as plain as the hump on a camel . You can't miss it . 
 No , I don't have it with me.But I know I have a reservation . My husband made it for me last month . 
 I bought mine from IKEA . 
 I lived there for three years . I like summer but I don't like winter . 
 Is there a charge for that . I know other stores have a restocking fee . 
 No , not at all . I was on the swimming team in high school.And I'd like to do some weight training . They have decent equipment at that gym . 
 You see , I bought it for my husband , but he doesn't like it . 

 Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! 
 My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that ! 
 I ’ m just not looking forward to cleaning it ! 
 I think that would be horrible ! 
 Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! 
 Really ? I ’ Ve never heard of it ! 
I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me ! 
 Are you nuts ! I ’ m not going to run a red light ! 
 Why tell me ? She has nothing to do with me !

I've had enough of that ! 
 I haven ’ t played softball since I was in high school ! 
 I'm absolutely useless at cooking ! 
 I ’ d really rather not . I ’ ll be too tempted to buy something that I can ’ t afford !

 So he is . But , why not try to help him to become stronger ? 
 that may be true . But I ’ m sure you ’ re able to find a balance between them . Why not try it ? 
 I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ? 
 I see . Why not use wooden cases ? 
 Of course , I think so . But how can you prove to me that you are more capable ? 
 Is that so ? Why not ? 
 You are , why not ask for a date ? 
 It's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning . What about trying something else ? 
 No , can I exchange it for a bigger one ? 
 Yes , but why should you want to do that ? 
 How do you think they could be ended ? 
 So then why would you ask them out in the first place ? 
 So then , why don't you drive it ? 
 But why do so many people live there ? 
 Then why do you want to sell it ?

 They're serviced regularly . We give them a basic service every 10,000 km or so and a main service once a year , or every 100,000 km . 
 We haven't had any problems so far . They offer a 24 - hour technical back-up service . We've called them in three times this month . They always arrive within a couple of hours . 
 Well , these are for internal use.You take a packet each time.Four times a day . 
 We cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % . 
 I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot . 
 They ’ re sales reps . They are very lazy . 
 We export to Eastern Europe and the Far East . The domestic market accounts for about 40 percent of our total sales . 
 We are always willing to choose the big ports as the loading ports . 
 What about the commission ? From European suppliers I usually get a 3 to 5 percent commission for my imports . It ’ s the general practice . 
 We make deliveries only for bulk buying . 
 Certainly . We provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year . 
 Yes , it ’ s reasonably fast but it certainly isn ’ t cheap . Fares have gone up25 % . 
 We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers . 
 Yes , we give 5 % discount for one week , 10 % for two weeks and more . 
 The train aren ’ t usually full . We can get them on the day we travel . We should buy return ticket because they are much cheaper than getting two singles . 

 As a rule we don ’ t allow any commission . But if the order is a substantial one , we ’ ll consider it . 
 As a rule we don't allow any commission . But if the order is sizable one , we will consider it . 
 In fact , if it weren't for our good relations , we wouldn't consider making you a firm order at this price . 
 If you can give us a more reduction , We'd be able to give you an order on the spot . 
 I ’ m sorry , but that ’ s our policy . 
 I think we ’ ll benefit a lot . 
 We have a position where that could work out well . 
 We'll have to negotiate that . It's a possibility . 
 I ’ m not sure , but in the meantime we will freeze these charges . 
 We have that available . 
 We can't be too cautious about these things . 
 We'll just give you a credit for the inconvenience . 
 Well , live and learn . It seems we'll have to waive the claim . 
 As a rule , we don't allow any discount . 
 we do actually . We can add that as an amendment to your contract . 

 You get off on Del Mar and Hill . 
 You need to get off on Fair Oaks and Washington . 
 You need to get off on the corner of Del Mar and Hill . 
 You're a quart low . 
 You have to catch it going west . 
You got a letter in the mail . 
 Oh , you like the rolling machine . 
 That's what you think . 
 You need to get on the 261 . It goes all the way to Sons . 
 It ’ s the one you like . 
 You ’ ll make more money that way . 
 You got me on that one . 
You have your ducks in a row . 
 But you've been looking for that stamp for years . 
 You'd just let sleeping dogs lie .
